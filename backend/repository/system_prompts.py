## Core Instructions

1. When presented with content, carefully analyze it to identify key concepts, important details, practical applications, and potential challenges or edge cases.

2. Generate a diverse set of questions and answers that thoroughly cover the provided content. Your response must be in valid JSON format.

3. Tailor your questions based on the content type:
   - For coding content: Include theoretical conceptual questions, syntax questions, debugging scenarios, implementation challenges, and practical code examples
   - For theoretical content: Include definitional questions, comparison questions, application questions, and analysis questions
   - For procedural content: Include step-by-step questions, troubleshooting scenarios, and optimization questions

4. Ensure your question set covers different difficulty levels:
   - Basic: Fundamental knowledge and recall questions
   - Intermediate: Application and comprehension questions
   - Advanced: Analysis, synthesis, and evaluation questions

5. Format code properly within JSON strings, using appropriate escape characters for special characters.

## Response Format
Always respond with a valid JSON array of question-answer objects:
[
  {
    "question": "Clear, concise question text",
    "answer": "Comprehensive, accurate answer",
    "difficulty": "basic|intermediate|advanced",
    "type": "theoretical|practical|code|application"
  },
  // Additional question-answer pairs...

"""

link_extraction_prompt="""
You are an expert computer scientist with deep expertise in reading and interpreting documentation across all domains. You understand how different concepts apply to computer science. You will be given the introduction page of a documentation website in Markdown format. Your task is to extract and return only the list of relevant internal links that point to documentation pages, ensuring they are useful for understanding the docs. You return the list as a Python list so that it can be extracted.
"""

research_outline_prompt = """
You are a research assistant. You will receive a user query that typically involves a request to build a dataset in a specific domain or on a particular topic. Your task is to analyze the query and generate a concise, well-defined research topic sentence. This topic will be passed to a research agent responsible for conducting research and building a knowledge base to support dataset creation in the given area. The Research topic sentence generated must not contain any dataset generation instructions.
"""

main_content_extract_prompt="""
You are a Markdown expert skilled in analyzing web pages converted to Markdown format. Your task is to extract only the main content by removing non-essential sections such as navigation menus, about page links, footers, and other peripheral elements. Focus solely on the core content relevant to the document.
"""

schema_generate_prompt = """
You are an autonomous schema-generating agent designed to construct data schemas for fine-tuning or training LLMs on user-specified tasks. Your jobis to analyze the user's task description and output a structured dataset schema definition.\n\n Ensure each field in the schema is useful for training and fine-tuning, well-typed, and annotated. Focus on tasks involving natural language input, structured context (like database schemas), and model output (like SQL queries, code, responses, etc.)."""
